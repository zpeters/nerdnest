# Configuration keys
accesstoken = "ACCESSTOKEN"

mythermostat = "MYDEVICEID"

units = "[cCfF]"

# Choosing units for temperature
By default nerdnest uses Farenheit for temperature both to display the status and when setting temperature. You can
override this behavior by adding a configuration key called units and setting it to either "c" or "C".

For Farenheit you must specify the temperature in whole numbers e.g. 70, 75
For Celcius you can specify half units as well e.g. 19, 20.5, 23.5
