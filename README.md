# DEPRECATED 
- since the acquisition of Nest by Google this api is no longer supported
- this project was started when many Go project structures and module idioms were still in flux, it does not represent current standards

# nerdnest
Control your Nest device from the command line

# Setup

1. Enable developer mode and allow access to your nest
  - https://github.com/zpeters/nerdnest/wiki/Nest-Developer-Account
2. Register nerdnest with your developer account
  - https://github.com/zpeters/nerdnest/wiki/Registering-nerdnest-with-your-account
3. Choose the device you want to control
  - https://github.com/zpeters/nerdnest/wiki/Select-your-Nest-Device
4. Make sure your settings from step 2 and 3 are saved into your nerdnest.toml file.  This file can be in:
  - $HOME/.nerdnest/nerdnest.toml
  - CURRENTDIRECTORY/nerdnest.toml

# Multiple device support
All commands that interact with a Nest can either use the default device from your config file or you can specify a device ID
e.g.
```
./nerdnest temp 70
./nerdnest temp 75 ku34h5kjefhkdsjfhsdf
./nerdnest status
./nerdnset status ku34h5kjefhkdsjfhsdf
```
To set the default device, even you only have one, run the setdefault command:
```
./nerdnest setdefault
Nest: raY9xdYrYY036u2rgaeP_lJ
Kitchen: ku34h5kjefhkdsjfhsdf
Enter default device ID from above list: ku34h5kjefhkdsjfhsdf
```
# Configuration keys
accesstoken = "ACCESSTOKEN"

mythermostat = "MYDEVICEID"

units = "[cCfF]"

# Choosing units for temperature
By default nerdnest uses Farenheit for temperature both to display the status and when setting temperature. You can
override this behavior by adding a configuration key called units and setting it to either "c" or "C".

For Farenheit you must specify the temperature in whole numbers e.g. 70, 75
For Celcius you can specify half units as well e.g. 19, 20.5, 23.5
